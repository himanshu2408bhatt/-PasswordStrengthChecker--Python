# -PasswordStrengthChecker--Python
A Python tool to evaluate password strength, highlight weaknesses, and visualize results. Provides detailed analysis of multiple passwords with a summary table and bar chart distribution.
# Password Strength Checker (Python)

A Python application that evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords, identifies weaknesses, and provides visual feedback through bar charts. This project combines programming fundamentals, data handling, and cybersecurity principles to encourage stronger password practices.


## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient Python application that assesses password strength using standard security criteria.  
It identifies weaknesses such as:
- Insufficient length
- Missing digits
- Absence of uppercase/lowercase letters
- Lack of special characters
- Presence of spaces  

Users receive immediate feedback, promoting stronger and more secure password creation.


##  Key Findings
- Passwords failing minimum length or character diversity → **Weak**  
- Passwords meeting most criteria but missing special characters → **Medium**  
- Passwords fulfilling all criteria → **Strong**  
- Visual analysis via bar charts provides a clear overview of password strength distribution.
